# Contributing to Smart Home Automation System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Class names should be PascalCase
   - Method names should be camelCase
   - Constants should be UPPER_CASE

2. **Documentation**
   - Comment complex algorithms
   - Document public methods
   - Update README.md for significant changes
   - Include example usage where appropriate

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep functions focused and small
   - Group related functionality
   - Use appropriate access modifiers
   - Maintain consistent formatting

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for new features
   - Include integration tests where necessary
   - Verify all sensors and actuators
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with any new features or changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers
4. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@smarthome.example.com instead of using the issue tracker. Security vulnerabilities will be addressed promptly.
